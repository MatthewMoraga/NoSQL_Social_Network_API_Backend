## Description
Backend development testing for mongo database and routing.

## Usage
Used Insomnia for testing.
Complete crud routing for the user and thought models.
also add and delete routes for removing/adding friends, and reactions as well.
When a user creates a user they can add friends and thoughts to the user by id.
reactions can be added to thoughts the same way.
